        <h1>Simatic</h1>
        <p class="italic-font">SIMATIC is a series of programmable logic controller and automation systems, developed by Siemens.
        Introduced in 1958, the series has gone through four major generations, the latest being the Simatic
        S7 generation. The series is intended for industrial automation and production. The name Simatic is a
        registered trademark of Siemens. It is a portmanteau of “Siemens” and “Automatic”.</p>

        <h2>Function</h2>
        <p>As with other programmable logic controllers, Simatic devices are intended to separate the control of
        a machine from the machine's direct operation, in a more lightweight and versatile manner than controls
        hard-wired for a specific machine. Early Simatic devices were transistor-based, intended to replace relays
        attached and customized to a specific machine. Microprocessors were introduced in 1973, allowing programs
        similar to those on general-purpose digital computers to be stored and used for machine control. Simatic
        devices have input and output modules to connect with controlled machines. The programs on the Simatic
        devices respond in real time to inputs from sensors on the controlled machines, and send output signals to
        actuators on the machines that directing their subsequent operation.</p>
        <p>Depending on the device and its connection modules, signals may be a simple binary value ("high" or "low")
        or more complex. For example, a binary input going from a thermometer on a machine to a Simatic device
        might have the following meanings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>“High” signal: Temperature exceeded an operating limit</li>
            <li>“Low” signal: Temperature is within expected limits</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Based on this input, and other factors, the program on the Simatic device might send a binary output
        signal to the same machine with the following meanings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>“High” signal: Run the motor</li>
            <li>“Low” signal: Stop the motor</li>
        </ul>
        <p>More complex inputs, outputs, and calculations were also supported as the Simatic line developed.
        For example, the Simatic 505 could handle floating point quantities and trigonometric functions.[</p>

        <h2>Product lines</h2>
        <p>Siemens has developed four product lines to date:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1958: Simatic Version G</li>
            <li>1973: Simatic S3</li>
            <li>1979: Simatic S5</li>
            <li>1995: Simatic S7</li>
        </ul>
